# Mechanistic Interpretability of RNNs emulating Hidden Markov Models

![Header image](pipe.svg)

This repository contains code for training, analyzing, and reverse engineering Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained on data generated from Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). This code reverse-engineers internal representations of RNNs from the global dynamical properties down to the single-neuron level mechanism. 

## Installation
### Requirements
Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can create a conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate hmmrnn
```

      - `seed_0/`, `seed_1/`, `seed_2/`: Different random seeds
        - `models/`: Trained model files
        - `config.json`: Containing metadata about RNN and HMM models

- `Three/`: Models trained on 3-state linear-chain HMMs
- `Four/`: Models trained on 4-state linear-chain HMMs
- `Five/`: Models trained on 5-state linear-chain HMMs
- `FullyConnected/`: Models trained on fully-connected HMM topologies
- `Cyclic/`: Models trained on cyclic HMM topologies
- `ReverseEngineeredModel/`: Contains the main RNN model used for detailed reverse engineering analysis at the single-neuron level

## Scripts

### config.py
Configuration module for HMM-RNN experiments. Defines different configuration classes:
`DefaultConfig`: Base configuration with default parameters. `HMMTwo`, `HMMThree`, `HMMFour`, `HMMFive`: Configurations for linear-chain HMMs used in the paper. Additional configurations for fully-connected (`HMMFully`) and cyclic (`HMMCyclic`) HMM topologies.
